      <description>After going back and forth on website layouts, I think I&amp;rsquo;ve finally landed.
For those of you who visited my previous website (there are dozens of us!), you&amp;rsquo;ll probably notice a change.
I&amp;rsquo;ve switched from Docusaurus to Hugo with the PaperMod theme.
The TLDR is that Hugo is more simple, has a more active theme ecosystem, and fits my use-case better.
What does this mean for my website? Well besides the obvious facelift, due to Hugo&amp;rsquo;s simplicity expect more regular posts from me.</description>

      <description>whoami I&amp;rsquo;m currently a Threat Hunting Engineer at Autodesk. I attempt to write down my semi-coherent thoughts here as well as on Twitter and LinkedIn, although the former not as much anymore. In my free time I enjoy kayaking, photography, reading, cooking and hiking. I&amp;rsquo;m from the PNW, what can I say.
I received my Associates in Computer Security from Lake Washington Institute of Technology in 2019 and my Bachelors in Cybersecurity from Western Washington University in 2022.</description>
